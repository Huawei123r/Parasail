        # --- Attempt to find and click "Login With Wallet" ---
        # This part is highly dependent on the website's actual HTML structure.
        # You'll likely need to inspect the website's elements in a regular browser
        # to find the exact selector for the "Login With Wallet" button.

        # Common selectors might be:
        #   - A button with specific text: page.get_by_text("Login With Wallet")
        #   - A button with a specific ID: page.locator("#loginButtonId")
        #   - A button with a specific class: page.locator(".login-wallet-button")

        # Let's try by text first, as it's common.
        # This will wait for the button to be visible and then click it.
        try:
            print("Looking for 'Login With Wallet' button...")

            await login_button.click()
            print("Clicked 'Login With Wallet' button.")

            # --- Critical Point: Wallet Interaction ---
            # After clicking "Login With Wallet", a wallet extension (like MetaMask)
            # usually pops up or redirects. Automating this interaction (entering password,
            # approving connection, signing) is the *most challenging* part.
            # Playwright itself doesn't directly control browser extensions.

            # You might need to:
            # 1. Manually set up a browser profile with MetaMask pre-installed and logged in.
            # 2. Use a Playwright feature that allows attaching to existing browser sessions (advanced).
            # 3. Consider if the dApp offers a WalletConnect QR code, which *could* be scanned
            #    by a separate mobile app, but this moves away from full automation.
            # 4. Use a specialized library or custom script to interact with MetaMask's internal
            #    pop-up window if it appears. This is complex and potentially risky.

            print("\n--- WARNING: Wallet interaction needs manual handling or advanced setup ---")
            print("After 'Login With Wallet' is clicked, a wallet extension (e.g., MetaMask)")

            # Now, you'd look for "Activate Node" and "Power Clicker" buttons
            # This again requires inspecting the webpage after login.

            # Example (assuming you're logged in and on the correct page)
            # try:
            #     print("Looking for 'Activate Node' button...")
            #     activate_node_button = page.get_by_text("Activate Node", exact=True)
